Noir is an open-source project specializing in identifying attack surfaces for enhanced whitebox security testing and security pipeline. 
This includes the capability to discover API endpoints, web endpoints, and other potential entry points within source code for thorough security analysis and DAST.

### Road Map
We plan to expand the range of supported programming languages and frameworks, and to increase accuracy. 
Initially conceived as a tool to assist with WhiteBox testing, our goal is to extract and provide endpoints from the source code within the DevSecOps Pipeline, enabling DAST to conduct more accurate and stable scans.
